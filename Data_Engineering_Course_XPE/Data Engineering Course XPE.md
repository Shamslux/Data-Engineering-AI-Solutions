# What is Data?

## Data

Data is a representation of facts about the real world.

## Information 

Information is data endowed with relevance and purpose.

For example, "green" is an example of data. A tree is green, and that is information.

## Knowledge

Knowledge is information contextualized by experience.

For example, the fact that a green tree is a characteristic of seasons like summer or spring (in some countries) is an
example of knowledge, information contextualized by experience.

In this way, data is an isolated fact, information is purposeful data, and knowledge is our experience applied to
obtained information.

# Types of Data

Data can be structured, semi-structured, or unstructured.

## Structured data

Structured data has a homogeneous and predefined structure, being a prescriptive structure (it prescribes how the
data will be organized) and very clear (e.g., a relational database with predefined structured tables, where we know
that one field is of integer type, another is a date, etc.).

## Semi-structured data 

Semi-structured data has a more heterogeneous schema and a structure that can be predefined but is less rigid. The
structure comes with the data. Some examples are XML or JSON files, where we can see that the data is accompanied by
structures (tags).

## Unstructured data

Unstructured data does not have predefined schemas, does not have a defined structure, and the structure and data
are mixed. Video and audio files, for example, are examples of unstructured data.

Currently, a significant portion of data is being collected as unstructured data. In this understanding, a tweet can be
unstructured data because such text is subject to subjectivity, and we do not know how the author (user) will present
their opinion (in what structure).

# Datafication

It is the phenomenon in which there is massive data collection through various devices and applications. For example,
our product opinions are collected (on social networks or specific platforms), our feelings (on social networks), our
choices and preferences (on social networks, shopping websites, web browsing), our professional profile (LinkedIn), etc.

As a result, we have a multitude of data sources such as:

- Open data (public)
- Official documents
- Articles and newspapers
- Websites
- Audio and video
- Spreadsheets
- Social networks
- Information systems
- Integration files
- Internet of Things (IoT)
- Web data and LOD (Linked Open Data)
- Databases
