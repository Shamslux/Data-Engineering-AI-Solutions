# What is Airflow?

Apache Airflow is an open-source platform used for orchestrating, scheduling, and automating complex data workflows. It allows users to define, schedule, and monitor workflows as directed acyclic graphs (DAGs), making it easier to manage and automate data processing, ETL (Extract, Transform, Load) tasks, and other workflow-related activities. Airflow is highly customizable, extensible, and widely used for data pipeline automation and management.
