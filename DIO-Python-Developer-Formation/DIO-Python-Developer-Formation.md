# Training Details

Python is one of the most used programming languages in both the national and international markets. It's one of the main technologies used by companies such as Globo, Instagram, Amazon, and Google.

With its great versatility, extensive documentation, and numerous libraries, Python is the first choice in the data field. However, Python is not limited to data; it can also be applied to games, web applications, task automation, and much more! Learn from scratch the basic syntax of the language up to integrations with APIs and practical projects exploring the main frameworks like Flask and Django.

Model your database with Sqlalchemy tools and create even richer applications with data persistence using MongoDB and the Pymongo library.

**Total Course Hours: 64 hours**

# About the Instructor

Guilherme Carvalho has 9 years of experience as a Backend Developer in Python and Java.

# Introduction to Python

Python was born in 1989 as a hobby of the programmer Guido Van Rossum. The initial idea was to continue the ABC language, which was developed by the Dutch Research Center (CWI).

Python was influenced by ABC, which was a language designed for beginners, because of its ease of learning and use.

Van Rossum's goals for the Python language were:

- An easy and intuitive language
- Open source, so everyone could contribute
- Code as intelligible as English.
- Suitable for daily tasks and productive

In 1995, Van Rossum released version `1.2`, while still working at CWI. After ending the link with the research center, he and the main Python development team moved to *BeOpen.com*, thus born the **BeOpen Python Labs**.

In October 2000, version `2.0` of Python is published. In this version, **List Comprehensions** are born and an improvement in the garbage collector for the removal of cyclic references.

In 2001, the Python Software Foundation (PSF) was born, which, from Python `2.1`, owns all the code, documentation, and specifications of the language.

In 2008, version `3.0` is launched. This version solved many design problems of the language and improved performance. Some changes were very profound, which made version `3.x` not backward compatible.

Currently, we are at version `3.12.2` (I updated, but for the original course, the instructor had said that the most current was `3.10.2`).

## Why and Where to Use Python?

Python is a very versatile language, see some characteristics:

- Dynamic and strong typing
- Cross-platform and multi-paradigm
- Huge and active community
- Low learning curve

**Note**: Python is not recommended for mobile development. Although there are some frameworks, they are not as good, since Python itself does not perform well in a mobile environment, therefore, it is much better to use other more established languages for mobile environments.
